//call,apply and bind are used either to 
// To borrow another objectâ€™s methods or
// To create a custom value of this

// Both  call  and  apply  invoke a function. 
// Their only difference is that  call  accepts arguments in a comma-separated fashion while  apply  requires arguments to be passed as an array or an array-like object.
// whereas bind returns a function with this keyword setup
