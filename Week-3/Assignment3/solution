'Count is 0' is what is logged while the count variable value will be 3

Increment is called 3 times so every time increment is called 1 is added to count variable 
and calling increment 3 times will make the value of count 3

When log is called it is going to print the message variable .Although the message string contains count variable
it prints 'Count is 0' because when string is formed at runtime the value of count was 0;
